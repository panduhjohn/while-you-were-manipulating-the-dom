Besides being incredibly inefficient (although this is a matter of principle more than app speed), this solution would teach you nothing about how to iterate over strings--and probably nothing about iterating over arrays either, since we don't have the foundational knowledge of arrays yet.
    * To get a complete string, we'll have to build a new string entirely.
    * It would probably _not_ make sense to go through the user input string in regular, 0 to sring.length order.

    Stretch Goal TODOS:

    * Make sure that you don't give them the same lucky number more than once. There are a few possible solutions to this, but don't use arrays! We'll get there soon. NOTE: the luckify stretch goals are particularly hard ones, feel free to come back after doing other stretch goals first.
    * If you're preventing them getting the same number, but they type in, say, a 3, your browser will enter an infinite loop, as you can't get 5 numbers from 1-3 without repeating a number. But you _could_ have it simply exit the loop earlier if the user entered a lower number than 5.
    * If you get a lucky number of 15, _some_ solutions to the above will prevent a 1 from coming afterwards, as it will consider the 1 digit in 15 as an instance of 1 having already occurred. (Feel free to test this with 19 as an input, and see if a number with a 1 digit is ever followed by a 1.) One solution to this involves the string method `padStart`... but feel free to find a different way!
